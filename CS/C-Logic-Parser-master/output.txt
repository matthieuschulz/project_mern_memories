(p^-p) is a binary. The first part is p and the second part is -p  
(p^-p) is not satisfiable.
-(p>p) is a negation.  
-(p>p) is not satisfiable.
-(p>(q>p)) is a negation.  
-(p>(q>p)) is not satisfiable.
-((p>q)>p) is a negation.  
-((p>q)>p) is satisfiable.
--((pvq)>(-p^-q)) is a negation.  
--((pvq)>(-p^-q)) is satisfiable.
((p>q)^(q>p)) is a binary. The first part is (p>q) and the second part is (q>p)  
((p>q)^(q>p)) is satisfiable.
-((p>(qvr))>((p>q)v(p>r))) is a negation.  
-((p>(qvr))>((p>q)v(p>r))) is not satisfiable.
((p>(qvr))>((p>q)v(p>r))) is a binary. The first part is (p>(qvr)) and the second part is ((p>q)v(p>r))  
((p>(qvr))>((p>q)v(p>r))) is satisfiable.
((p>q)^(-q>-p)) is a binary. The first part is (p>q) and the second part is (-q>-p)  
((p>q)^(-q>-p)) is satisfiable.
((pvq)^p>-q) is not a formula.  
I told you, ((pvq)^p>-q) is not a formula.
